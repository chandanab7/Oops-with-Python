# Problem Statement
# Create a program for a College Management System using Hybrid Inheritance.
# Requirements
# Create a class Person
# Attribute:
# name
# Method:
# display_person()
# Create a class Student that inherits from Person
# Attribute:
# student_id
# Method:
# display_student()
# Create a class SportsPlayer that inherits from Person
# Attribute:
# sport_name
# Method:
# display_sports_player()
# Create a class CollegeStudent that inherits from both Student and SportsPlayer
# Attribute:
# college_name
# Method:
# display_college_student()
# Create one object of CollegeStudent and display all details.



# hybrid inheritance is a combination of multiple and hierarchical inheritance. In this example, 
# we have a base class `Person`, two derived classes `Student` and `SportsPlayer` that inherit from `Person`,
# and a further derived class `CollegeStudent` that inherits from both `Student` and `SportsPlayer`. 
# This allows us to create a college student who has attributes and methods from both the student and 
# sports player classes, as well as the person class.
